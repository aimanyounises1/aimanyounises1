## About Me

Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Amdocs with 3+ years building enterprise-scale telecom solutions for tier-one providers. I architect production systems that combine mission-critical performance with intelligent automation, delivering measurable business impact across distributed teams.

My unique technical positioning bridges two demanding domains: **low-level systems programming** (C++, CUDA, GPU optimization) and **cutting-edge AI innovations** (multi-agent systems, GraphRAG, LangGraph). This rare combination enables me to build high-performance AI solutions that scale from embedded hardware to enterprise infrastructure.

B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Ariel University (2022, high distinction). Pioneer Award recipient. Fluent in English, Hebrew, and Arabic.
